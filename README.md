# faculty networks
A project to explore faculty networks in university departments

This is a project to learn and demostrate some data science skills. It began with the question "Where do faculty study and then work?". As a PhD student I am very interested in where people end up with their degree.

This project will involve gathering data on faculty, which is a messy process as there doesn't seem to be a nice central respository of faculty with the infromation needed for this project. I will gather this data from department websites in the 2018-2019 academic year. The focus will be on people with the following types of positions: Lecturer, Assistant Professor, Associate Professor, Professor, and various types of Research or Teaching professors. I am focusing on the department I am in&mdash;Parks, Recreation and Tourism&mdash;then will work to include other departments at other universities that are similar. These will be the departments that we can imagine send personel to each other as they graduate PhD's.

To be continued...
